# React Chat Application with Socket.io  ðŸš€
 
This project is a real-time chat application built using React for the frontend and Node.js with Express and Socket.io for the backend.

## Features

- Real-time messaging: Users can send and receive messages instantly.
- Multiple users: Supports multiple users chatting simultaneously.
- Responsive design: The application is designed to work seamlessly across various devices and screen sizes.

## Folder Structure

- `server`: Contains the backend code implemented in Node.js with Express.
- `chatapp`: Houses the frontend code implemented in React.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/Mayank1242/ChatApp
```

2. Install dependencies for both the server and chatapp:

```
cd server
npm install

cd ../chatapp
npm install
```

## Usage

```
cd server
npm start
```

This will start the backend server on `http://localhost:5000`.
